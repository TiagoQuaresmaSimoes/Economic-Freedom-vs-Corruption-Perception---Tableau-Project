Introduction:

This study, spanning from 2017 to 2022 and encompassing 172 nations, sets out to explore the intricate relationship between economic freedom and the perception of corruption. Economic freedom, a concept denoting the extent to which individuals can control their labor and property, is quantitatively assessed through the Economic Freedom Index. This index considers factors such as property rights protection, contract enforcement, currency stability, and the degree of government intervention. Higher economic freedom typically correlates with increased prosperity, economic growth, and individual well-being.

On the other hand, the Corruption Perception Index (CPI) gauges the perceived levels of corruption within the public sector of different countries. Compiled by organizations like Transparency International, the CPI reflects expert and citizen assessments. A higher CPI score implies lower perceived corruption, while a lower score suggests the opposite.

Understanding this relationship is paramount for developing informed policies that not only foster economic success but also uphold national integrity. Corruption, a significant impediment to development, erodes public trust in institutions and compromises effective governance. Therefore, the study aspires to contribute valuable insights that can inform policymakers and aid in the formulation of strategies to address both economic concerns and corruption-related challenges on a national scale

Tools used: Python, Tableau, Excel

Usage instructions :

On the 2nd page, the main objective is to see the Index analysis and study the relationship between them. Also is possible to see the evolution of the rankings of both indexes during the time period.

After taking some conclusions on the 3rd page, we go deeper into the analysis, and it is possible to study some socioeconomic, positions on the rankings and scores, the economic freedom variables analysis, and the relation between those variables and the Corruption perception index.

To finish if the user doesn't dominate some of the topics on the last page we have some definitions of some of the indicators.
